# MakersBnB 

## Project Overview

A project to replicate core AirBnB functionality as a team, on a fresh Tech Stack.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository.

The project requires Express:
```
npm install express --save
```
Run the application and navigate to the local host (http://localhost:3000/)
```
node app.js
```
## Successes - What did we learn?

* We designed and put together a Tech Stack with all un-familiar Technology, in an unfamiliar language and got the app working in 4 days.
* We followed the dev workflow including always relating work back to a user story and tracking that work on a Trello board.
* Daily Stand Ups and Retros.
* An example of a great team decision was switching feature test suite to Zombie after a lack of success integrating Chai.
* Perseverance in identifying the required information from documentation.

## Challenges

* Breaking up the work into taks which could be tackled by pairs. Much of the work was done on one computer as a 'pair' of four.
* Keeping up with the amount of new Tech especially Express (on account of how much it does for us).
* Frustration at the 'lack of writing actual code' versus reasearch via documentation.
* Difficulty in finding the right balance between making progress on features versus being certain at each point that we would be able to re-integrate those features into the master at the correct point.
